This website is not marketed to attract more audience. It is visited only by a known audience.<\/li>\n<li>A few entrepreneurs have developed an app for their business. However it&#8217; doesn&#8217;t have a strong user base.<\/li>\n<li>Some of the businessmen still don&#8217;t believe in virtual marketing. Hence they don&#8217;t have an online presence yet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Marketing matters most where the Audience is !!!\u00a0 The study says a person on an average spends 2 hours \/day on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>The question comes in again, What should you do??<br \/>\nThe answer depends on case to case basis. We have tried to jot down some simple scenarios.<\/p>\n<address><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Case 1<\/span>:\u00a0Pure Local Business<\/strong><\/address>\n<p>Your business is local such that your reach is less than 3-4 km of radius and you don&#8217;t even think the circumference is going to grow. Say your Margins are not too high.<br \/>\ne.g. Local Kirana shop, Restaurant, Dentist, local clothes shop, etc.<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Basic Website (template-based) can be good, to begin with for some of the purely local business types as it helps for Brand building &amp; Awareness. If your competitors have an online presence, It becomes a must to have a website and promote using different Digital Marketing techniques.<\/li>\n<li>For this scenario, a mobile application is typically not recommended (maybe 1\/100 exceptions) as your target audience is too less. It would be tough to have a good visitor count on your application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can opt for\u00a0<strong>Social Media tools like Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram,<\/strong>\u00a0etc. for marketing with minimal investments.<\/p>\n<address><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Case 2<\/span>:\u00a0Local with good reach.<\/strong><\/address>\n<p>Your business is Local, however, you can cover a city with a circumference of around 15-20 km radius.<br \/>\ne.g. Specialized treatment center,\u00a0 Manufacturer, etc.<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>For this scenario, the Developing &amp; Marketing website could be a good move. Ensure you design a responsive website &amp; start promoting it. The website will help to build a brand for your company. Since you are widespread, you cannot afford marketer or sales guy everywhere.<\/li>\n<li>Developing app and mobile marketing might not be cost-effective for every business.\u00a0 However, there can be some exceptions too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<address><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Case 3<\/span>: You are a mid-size firm.<\/strong><\/address>\n<p>We would consider a company with 50-1000 employees as mid-size<br \/>\ne.g. CA firm, Shipping &amp; Logistics company, etc.<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>The website is a must for a mid-size firm. For mid-size companies (100+), typically website is present. Some of the companies are not promoting it. You definitely need to Promote your website for Brand Building, Lead generation &amp; sales (if applicable).<\/li>\n<li>The mobile app helps in brand creation. However, creating an App needs to have a clear purpose.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In case you are targeting an App for your Leads\/ Customer, you need to ensure it gives continuous benefits to them (in terms of time or money or both).\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t make sense for a user to install your app otherwise. Additionally, you will have to market your app through online\/ offline ways. Add that cost to your development cost and calculate ROI.<\/p>\n<address><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Case 4<\/span>:\u00a0You are a big firm<\/strong><\/address>\n<p>Big is a subjective term. However, We are considering companies with 1000+ employees as big here.<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>The big firm will have websites and most of them would be promoting it too. Some of them are leaders in their specific domain.<\/li>\n<li>You can create an App for internal employees which will save your operational time and can give ease to employees. It&#8217;s worth going ahead. ROI would be quick as you have a huge employee base. You can also Target a mobile app for Brand building (which is a must if your business is a niche). If you are targeting Sales from your Mobile App, give better discounts via an app (like most eCommerce businesses are doing it currently).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>If you have additional queries or want to know more about Digital Marketing, you can always reach us at\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\nEmail:\u00a0<a style=\"color: #f08324; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"mailto:info@consultingpandit.com\">info@consultingpandit.com<\/a><br \/>\nPhone: 9967006659<br \/>\nWebsite:\u00a0<a style=\"color: #f08324; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalconsultingpandit.com\/\">www.digitalconsultingpandit.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Please share your comments !!!<\/p>\n<p>#DigitalMarketing #DigitalConsultingPandit #WebsiteMarketing #DoINeedWebsite #MobileMarketing<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Does my Business need a Website or a Mobile App for Digital Marketing?
