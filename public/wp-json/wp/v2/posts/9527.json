Professional degree holders like <em><strong>CA, Engineers (specifically IT), CS,\u00a0 Interior designers, etc<\/strong><\/em>. opted for jobs over starting own business or joining the family business. Being employees of an organization became a safer option. People were happy with monthly <strong><em>paychecks<\/em><\/strong>. The <strong>switching\u00a0job<\/strong>\u00a0was like an additional top-up. With a minor glitch in 2009-2010, employment increased exponentially. Salary went up year on year and so went spending. <em><strong>Foreign trips, buying houses, new cars, etc.<\/strong><\/em> were not uncommon.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gradually things have started changing. Few bunches of people started feeling their work <em><strong>monotonous<\/strong><\/em>. Some are unable to see the growth as they would like to see. People feel Increments just cover inflation.\u00a0<em><strong>Job switch<\/strong><\/em> does not seem as easy as it was during their early professional carrier. EMI\u2019s are also a cause of worry for a few of them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few people have started thinking in a different direction and fetched <em><strong>new ideas<\/strong><\/em>. For some people planning state is in progress and some people have started the implementation of their ideas. People are <em><strong>investing time<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong><em>money<\/em>\u00a0<\/strong>(or both) towards new ideas. More and more\u00a0<em><strong>startups<\/strong><\/em> are emerging. Some of them are getting bigger by funds received from Venture capitalists while some are still a small scale.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People have started moving towards\u00a0<em><strong>entrepreneurship<\/strong><\/em>, however, <em><strong>not all<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0of them are\u00a0<em><strong>leaving their job<\/strong><\/em>. For instance, when\u00a0<em><strong>Zomato<\/strong>\u00a0<\/em>started, not all of its partners were full time into the business. Some of them were still working as an employee and were doing <em><strong>part-time entrepreneurship<\/strong><\/em>. This concept of doing\u00a0<em><strong>business as well as a job<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0simultaneously can be termed as\u00a0<strong>Semi Entrepreneurship.<\/strong> This concept has seen a rise. Until the time semi-entrepreneur gets good returns or has a good forecast or receive funding for their business, they continue with their job. This ensures a study <em><strong>source of income<\/strong><\/em> (with time as a trade-off) for their business.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of them are using\u00a0<em><strong>IT (Information Technology)<\/strong>\u00a0<\/em>as one of the tools to promote their business online. The best part of using IT is, it does not need your availability in real-time. For instance:- Your website speaks what business you do. Your e-commerce portal <em><strong>generates revenues<\/strong>\u00a0<\/em>without your manual intervention.
